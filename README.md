## Powerbi-AtliQo-Telecom-Analysis-Project

### AtliQo is one of the leading telecom providers in India and launched its 5G plans in May 2022 along with other telecom providers.
### However, the management noticed a decline in their active users and revenue growth post 5G launch in May 2022. AtliQo’s business director requested their analytics ### team to provide a comparison report of KPIs between pre and post-periods of the 5G launch. The management is keen to compare the performance between these periods ### and get insights that would enable them to make informed decisions to recover their active user rate and other key metrics. They also wonder if they can optimize 
### their internet plans to get more active users.  Peter Pandey, a junior data analyst, is assigned to this task.
